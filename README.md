# sensors-server

This is a data provider for https://github.com/eamanola/systemmonitor, an app to repurpose old phones as internal hw monitor.

This project is meant as a starting point / example, and will need tweaking depending on your setup.

The commands used here are for linux + nvidia gpu.

## system monitor app

This app is meant to run on a device, inside of pc case. adb/ folder contains some useful commands, to interact with the device, without opening the case.

## help wanted

- to make the commands system independant
- add windows support
